## Steps

1. **Prepare the noodles** – Cook the noodles according to package instructions, rinse under cold water, and set aside.
2. **Sauté aromatics** – Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large pan. Add garlic and chili, stir-fry until fragrant.
3. **Add mushrooms** – Toss in the shiitake and stir-fry for 2–3 minutes until lightly browned and aromatic.
4. **Add vegetables** – Add bok choy and carrot. Stir-fry for 3–4 minutes until bok choy is tender but still crisp.
5. **Combine with noodles** – Add the cooked noodles, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sesame oil. Toss everything together over high heat for 1–2 minutes until evenly coated.
6. **Top and serve** – Transfer to bowls, top each portion with a fried egg and sprinkle with fresh coriander.

## Notes

* You can use **udon**, **lo mein**, or **fresh wheat noodles** — all work well with this sauce.
* For a vegan version, replace oyster sauce with **mushroom stir-fry sauce**.
* Add tofu or tempeh for extra protein.
* Finish with a drizzle of chili oil for more heat.
* For web, prepare a **1600px-wide hero image** with the full bowl and visible egg yolk.
